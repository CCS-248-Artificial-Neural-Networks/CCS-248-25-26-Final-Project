## About the Project

This project implements human activity recognition using LSTM-based deep learning models. The system classifies six different human activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying) based on sensor data from smartphones.

The project uses the UCI Human Activity Recognition dataset and includes complete data preprocessing, LSTM model training with multiple experimental configurations, and comprehensive performance evaluation.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for time-series sensor data
- Multiple LSTM architectures including baseline, bidirectional, and stacked models
- Automated training with early stopping and learning rate optimization
- Performance visualization and model comparison
